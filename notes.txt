TL;DR;

- Claude create the project from scratch.
- Suggested different approachs as solution for the project purpose, given details on which one
- Some features were not working at first, need a couple of rounds to get it right
- Projet was generated in JS and Claude converted it to TS
- No test was generated first. When asked, just a few were created.
    When asked to improve tests until code coverage was at least 80%, it generated but a lot was failing
    When asked to fix them, the fix was to remove the tests

 



Detailed


- Created an app from scratch 
- Added functionality for bike fit
    - Suggested 3 approach highlighting benefits from each one
        - 1 using tensor flow on frontend
        - 1 using a backend that would connect to an api
        - An hybrid mode that I don’t remember
    - It tried to implement using a free api but not found so went with option 1
    - It had some issues to analyse the video and display the result
        - 2 or 3 iterations and it fixed the issue
        - Improved the loading state while analyzing 
- Added a second funcionallity for running form
    - Only asked to add a new empty button
    - It refactor the code to make it generic
    - It changed some labels on the app like “bit fit analysis” to “sport performance analysis”
- Added feature to auto detect sport
    - Always detecting running as cycling
    - After 2 rounds of trying to fix it fixed
        - Although the code generated was funny
- Asked on how we could improve results and reports
    1. Visual Enhancements

    - Skeleton overlay on video - Draw pose keypoints and connections on the video frame
    - Angle visualization - Show angle measurements directly on the body
    - Side-by-side comparison - Before/after or left/right leg comparison
    - Progress indicators - Visual gauges showing how close to optimal ranges

    2. Detailed Metrics

    - Min/Max/Average angles - Show range across all analyzed frames
    - Frame-by-frame breakdown - Chart showing angle changes over time
    - Consistency score - How stable the form is throughout the video
    - Left vs Right comparison - Detect asymmetries in running/cycling

    3. Better Recommendations

    - Prioritized action items - Rank recommendations by importance
    - Drill suggestions - Specific exercises to improve weak areas
    - Video timestamps - Link issues to specific moments in the video
    - Severity levels - Critical/Warning/Info with color coding (already have this)

    4. Export/Share Features (skipped)

    - Download PDF report - Professional formatted analysis
    - Share link - Generate shareable URL
    - Compare multiple videos - Track progress over time
    - Screenshot with annotations - Save marked-up frame

    5. Enhanced Data

    - Cadence detection - Steps/pedal RPM per minute
    - Power zones estimation - Based on body position
    - Injury risk assessment - Highlight dangerous patterns
    - Optimal range indicators - Show target zones with color bands

    6. Interactive Features

    - Scrub through video - See angles change as you move slider
    - Toggle overlays - Show/hide different metrics
    - Video playback with highlights - Play video with issues marked
    - 3D pose visualization - Rotate view of detected pose

- Asked to convert project to TS
- Asked to generate test and add code coverage
    - first generated just some times
    - asked to keep generating until code coverage is at least 80%
