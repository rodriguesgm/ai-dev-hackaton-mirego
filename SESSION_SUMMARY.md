# Sports Performance Analysis App - Development Summary

## Project Overview
React 19 + Vite application for analyzing bike fit and running form using TensorFlow.js pose detection.

## Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- Video upload with validation (max 30sec, 20MB)
- Sport auto-detection (cycling vs running)
- TensorFlow.js MoveNet pose estimation
- Real-time pose analysis with angle calculations

### #1 - Visual Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- **Skeleton overlay**: Green lines connecting joints, red keypoint dots
- **Angle visualization**: Yellow arcs with measurements on body
- **Visual gauges**: Color-coded bars showing angles within optimal ranges
- Files: `src/utils/skeletonDrawing.js`

### #2 - Detailed Metrics (COMPLETED)
- **Statistics table**: Min/Max/Avg/Range/Consistency for each angle
- **Frame-by-frame charts**: Bar visualization of angle variation
- **Consistency scoring**: 0-100% with color-coded ratings
- **Asymmetry analysis**: Left vs Right comparison with balance indicators
- Files: `src/utils/detailedMetrics.js`, `src/components/DetailedMetrics.jsx`

### #3 - Better Recommendations (COMPLETED)
- **Severity scoring**: Critical/Moderate/Minor classification based on deviation
- **Impact statements**: Explains consequences of each form issue
- **Exercise drills**: 3-4 specific actionable drills per recommendation
- **Priority sorting**: Recommendations ordered by severity (critical first)
- **Enhanced UI**: Color-coded badges, background tints, hover effects
- Files: `src/utils/enhancedRecommendations.js`, updated BikeFitAnalysis/RunningFormAnalysis components

### #5 - Enhanced Data (ROLLED BACK)
- Feature was implemented but rolled back by user

### #6 - Interactive Features (COMPLETED)
- **Video scrubbing**: Seek through video with timeline control
- **Live angle updates**: Frame-by-frame pose data synchronized with video position
- **Toggle overlays**: Show/hide skeleton and angle measurements on demand
- **Issue markers**: Timeline markers showing critical/moderate issues with tooltips
- **Video playback controls**: Play/pause, skip forward/backward 2 seconds
- **Jump to issues**: Click on issue markers or list items to seek to problem areas
- Files: `src/components/InteractiveVideo.jsx`, updated BikeFitAnalysis/RunningFormAnalysis components

## Key Components

### Analysis Components
- `BikeFitAnalysis.jsx`: Analyzes knee, hip, elbow, back angles
- `RunningFormAnalysis.jsx`: Analyzes body lean, knee lift, hip extension, arm swing
- `DetailedMetrics.jsx`: Displays comprehensive metrics, charts, asymmetry
- `InteractiveVideo.jsx`: Video player with scrubbing, overlays, and issue markers

### Utilities
- `poseDetection.js`: TensorFlow.js MoveNet integration, angle calculations
- `bikeFitAnalysis.js`: Bike-specific angle analysis and recommendations
- `runningAnalysis.js`: Running-specific gait analysis
- `sportDetection.js`: Auto-detect cycling vs running from video
- `skeletonDrawing.js`: Canvas drawing for pose overlay
- `detailedMetrics.js`: Statistical calculations and metrics
- `enhancedRecommendations.js`: Severity scoring and exercise drill suggestions

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Video upload → Sport detection
2. Pose detection on 8-10 frames
3. Angle calculations per frame
4. Statistical aggregation (min/max/avg)
5. Recommendations generation
6. Visual rendering (skeleton + metrics)

### Key Metrics Tracked

#### Bike Fit
- Knee angle (140-160° optimal)
- Hip angle (40-70° optimal)
- Elbow angle (140-170° optimal)
- Back angle (35-50° optimal)

#### Running Form
- Body lean (5-12° optimal)
- Knee lift (100-140° optimal)
- Hip extension (160-180° optimal)
- Arm swing (80-110° optimal)

## Enhancements Status

### Completed
- ✅ #1: Visual Enhancements (skeleton, angles, gauges)
- ✅ #2: Detailed Metrics (statistics, charts, asymmetry)
- ✅ #3: Better Recommendations (severity, drills, impact)
- ✅ #6: Interactive Features (video player, scrubbing, markers)

### Skipped/Rolled Back
- ⏭️ #4: Export/Share Features (skipped)
